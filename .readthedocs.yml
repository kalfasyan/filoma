build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  commands:
    # Copy RTD stubs so the docs build doesn't require the Rust extension.
    - mkdir -p src/filoma
    - cp docs/rtd_stubs/filoma_core.py src/filoma/filoma_core.py
    # Install the docs requirements in the RTD build environment.
    - pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install -r docs/requirements-docs.txt
    # Make package importable for mkdocstrings by copying source to repo root
    - cp -r src/filoma .

# (No explicit `python.version` key â€” installation is handled in
# `build.commands` to avoid RTD schema validation errors.)
# Tell RTD we are using MkDocs and point at the repo config
mkdocs:
  configuration: mkdocs.yml

# Make the package importable by copying `src/filoma` to the repo root during
# the build. This avoids needing to set `PYTHONPATH` in the RTD YAML.

# Notes for maintainers:
# - If you want RTD to install the package itself (e.g. for examples that
#   import compiled extensions), add a pip install step (path: .) but be
#   aware that this will invoke the build backend and require Rust/tooling.
# - If you later need a Rust extension present in RTD builds, enable a
#   pre-build step to install rust (or use a custom build image) and
#   then pip-install the package in editable mode with the docs extras.
