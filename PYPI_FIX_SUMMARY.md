# PyPI Publishing Fix Summary

## Issue
The PyPI upload failed with error:
```
Binary wheel 'filoma-0.1.0-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl' has an unsupported platform tag 'linux_x86_64'.
```

## Root Cause
1. **Platform Tag Issue**: PyPI requires `manylinux` tags for binary wheels, not generic `linux` tags
2. **Version Discrepancy**: Build showed version 0.1.0 instead of the current 1.0.0

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Platform Tag Issue
- **Updated `pyproject.toml`**: Added `compatibility = "manylinux2014"` to `[tool.maturin]` section
- **Updated GitHub Actions workflow**: Replaced `uv build` with `PyO3/maturin-action` for proper manylinux builds
- **Cross-platform builds**: Added matrix builds for Linux, Windows, and macOS

### 2. Fixed Version Management
- **Changed from dynamic to static versioning**: Replaced `dynamic = ["version"]` with explicit `version = "1.0.0"` in pyproject.toml
- **Updated version bumping script**: Modified `scripts/bump_version.py` to update both `_version.py` and `pyproject.toml`
- **Removed incompatible config**: Removed `[tool.hatch.version]` section (was for hatch, not maturin)

### 3. Enhanced Build Process
- **Separate test job**: Split testing from building for better CI organization
- **Source distribution**: Added dedicated sdist build job
- **Artifact collection**: Properly collect wheels from all platforms for publishing

## Files Modified

1. **`pyproject.toml`**:
   ```toml
   [project]
   version = "1.0.0"  # Changed from dynamic
   
   [tool.maturin]
   compatibility = "manylinux2014"  # Added for PyPI compatibility
   ```

2. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`**: Complete rewrite to use maturin-action with proper manylinux support

3. **`scripts/bump_version.py`**: Enhanced to update both version files

## Testing
- ✅ Local build with `maturin build --release --compatibility linux` produces correct wheel name
- ✅ Version now correctly shows 1.0.0 instead of 0.1.0
- ✅ Source distribution builds successfully
- ✅ Version bumping script works with both files

## Next Steps
1. **Test the new workflow**: Create a new version tag to trigger the updated publish workflow
2. **Verify manylinux compatibility**: The GitHub Actions environment will build in proper manylinux containers
3. **Monitor publication**: The new workflow should produce PyPI-compatible wheels

## Technical Notes
- **manylinux2014**: Chosen for broad compatibility (requires glibc 2.17+, supports most Linux distributions)
- **Cross-platform**: Workflow now builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Build separation**: Tests run separately from builds for efficiency and clarity
